Description of files in this folder:

1. Updated_Table_S1A_before_outlier_removal: Starting dataset containing the estimated ddPCR copy number for 9 genes and 100 individuals. Replicate measurements are provided in columns a, b, c, d, e, and f.

2. haplogroup_info_11202017.txt: File containing haplogroup information for each individual. 

3. ddpcr_outliers_removed.txt: File generated after running the "cleaning_data.R" script on "Updated_Table_S1A_before_outlier_removal". The file contains the copy number information for each gene and individual averaged across replicates after outliers were removed. Also contains haplogroup information.

4. y_unrooted_tree.nwk: Starting, unrooted phylogenetic tree representing the relationship among Y chromosomes of 100 males. The tree was generated from SNP data. 

5. y_rooted_tree.nwk: Rooted Y chromosomal tree. 

6. pca_snps.eigenval: Eigenvectors resulting from PCA on SNP genotypes of 100 males

7. pca_snps.eigenvec: Eigenvalues from PCA on SNP genotypes of 100 males

8. phenotype_data.txt: File containing the measured/reported height and facial masculinity scores for study participants

9: y_snp_alignment_decoded. fasta
