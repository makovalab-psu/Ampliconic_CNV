Data files required for EVE analysis are contained in this folder. These files are generated by the ANOVA_cnv.R script.

1. y_eve.exprdat: Copy number data for 9 ampliconic genes (rows) for every individual (columns). The individual columns are arranged by haplogroup in the order that they appear on the "y_timetree_haplo_eveinput.nwk" tree (required by EVE). The first row specifies the number of genes (required by EVE).

2. y_eve.nindv: The number of individuals in each haplogroup - arranged in the same order as the tree. 

3. y_timetree_haplo.nwk: tree in newick format generated for EVE analysis. 

4. y_timetree_haplo_eveinput.nwk: same as y_timetree_haplo_eveinput.nwk, except the first row specifies the number of haplogroups (required by EVE). This tree is the actual input for EVE.
